# Isekai

* This is an unfinished development of a 2.5D Minecraft-clone (that I envisioned) using my `rubuild` (my owng game engine that I have not yet extracted out from this repo, located inside `lib/`)
* There was something that I got stuck and could not readily fix, and I lost motivation unfortunately.
* I got the "positioning" and "rendering" part of the game engine ready already, though as you could see below:

## Technologies
* SDL
* rubuild (my own game engine)
* [super_callbacks gem (also my own gem built mainly for this)](https://github.com/jrpolidario/super_callbacks)
